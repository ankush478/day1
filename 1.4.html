<h1> BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ANKUSH</h1>
<h2> My Top 3 movies of all time </h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Inside Out 2</h3><p> became the highest-grossing animated film of all time.</p>
<h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3><P>The film revived huge interest in superhero-genre movies with a bold, unapologetic style, blending irreverent humor, mature themes, and familiar beloved characters in a way that resonated globally.</P>
<h3>Despicable Me 4</h3> <P>t brings back the fun, lighthearted comedy and slapstick charm that fans love — with classic “minion mayhem,” family-friendly adventure, and a storyline that continues the lives of familiar characters.
